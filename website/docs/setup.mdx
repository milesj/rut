title: Setup

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

Begin by installing the `rut-dom` package (or another renderer specific package) as a dev
dependency. Since this is a React testing library, be sure `react`, and `react-dom` (or
`react-native`, etc) is also installed.

<Tabs
  groupId="package-manager"
  defaultValue="yarn"
  values={[
    { label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn' },
    { label: 'NPM', value: 'npm' },
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="yarn">


```bash
yarn add --dev rut-dom
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm">


```bash
npm install --save-dev rut-dom
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


And that's it! Head over to the [API](./api/render.md) for more information on how to use
`render()`, `renderAndWait()`, and others -- or continue reading for testing framework specific
functionality.
